To compile with g++ 7.3.0, run Compile.bat.
To generate umf and dvf files, run Run.bat.

NOTE: TranslatedCyclers.umf is too big for me to commit to github. So you will have to generate your own using the TranslatedCyclers Decider.

This Decider takes the 3,574,222 undecided machines from the TranslatedCyclers Decider (with time limt 10,000) and classifies 2,035,998 machines as non-halting. Time: 21.7s.

The accepted Decider from the bbchallenge site classified 2,036,010 machines as halting. The discrepancy proved to be due to a bug in the accepted Decider, which incorrectly classified twelve machines as non-halting.

Unfortunately the BackwardReasoning machines are not amenable to verification in the same way as Cyclers and TranslatedCyclers. So acceptance is difficult to justify, as there seems to be no better method than simply analysing the source code for bugs...
